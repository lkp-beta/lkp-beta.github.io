      <p>
        On behalf of Calvin Klein Cosmetics Company, I want to thank you for doing such a wonderful
        job at our Cocktail Reception at the Metropolitan Club. It was a pleasure to meet you and a
        pleasure to listen to such beautiful music. Thank you again. I look forward to working with
        you again in the future.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was love at first sight!! We first met in October 1995 when The Larry King Orchestra
        performed at my daughter Jennifer&#39;s wedding. We knew immediately how much you and your
        orchestra contributed to the success of the evening! From then on, we knew you would be
        involved in all our future family events ... birthdays, weddings, anniversaries!
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the years ... you have always been there, with your charm and grace, to lead the
        evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I can hardly wait to celebrate my first grandchild&#39;s Bat Mitzvah and we&#39;re
        delighted that Larry King Productions will be providing the DJ, dancers and special
        entertainment for Hannah&#39;s big celebration. We know it&#39;ll be superb, as always.
      </p>

        A thousand thanks and all my love. . .<br />

      <p>
        I&#39;m still in delirious shock and (nearly!) speechless after my fifteenth anniversary as
        anchor and managing editor of the Evening News. Your music was a big part of that
        celebration. I can&#39;t begin to tell you how much it meant to hear such excellent playing
        from the entire group. You caught &mdash; and defined &mdash; the mood of the entire
        evening.
      </p>
      <p>From the bottom of my heart, thank you.</p>
      <p>

        Thank you again for performing at the New York University School of Law Weinfeld Gala. Your
        performance helped make our gala evening a success. You were terrific! We also appreciate
        your promptness and responsiveness to our concerns. You were a pleasure to work with.

      <p className="name">Dear Larry,</p>
      <p>
        Thank you for your incredible music at the wedding at the St. Regis. The fact that the bride
        and groom chose your band after interviewing as many bands as they did is a major
        compliment. And of course it was the &quot;perfect&quot; choice. Your music was just the
        right mix for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone from my 80-year old country club in-laws dancing the mambo, to my new Argentinian
        in-laws, to the sophisticated Euros from Berlin and Paris, and even Tokyo, loved your band.
        The string quartet for the ceremony was elegant and the Stephane Grappelli trio you put
        together for the cocktails was fabulous.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks Larry for a lovely party. Can&#39;t wait for the next one!</p>
      <p>
        Best, best, best! <br />

      </p>
      <p>
        Our wedding on the rooftop terrace of the Hudson exceeded all expectations. The music by
        Larry King was faultless. It was an amazing event that people will not forget, and will talk
        about for a long time!

        We&#39;re still hearing raves about our 1,000th Performance Gala at the Americas Society.
        Many of the raves focused on how terrific your music was and I agree wholeheartedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was particularly attuned to the fact that you constantly had your eye on the dance floor,
        and &quot;went with the flow&quot;. You seemed to sense exactly when to change the tempo and
        style, and as a result, the floor was always full. Selecting an orchestra is always a major
        responsibility for the chair of an event, since music is such a crucial element to the
        success of a party. You did me proud, Larry, and I am truly grateful.
      </p>

        Thanks again,

      <p>
        From Sharon&#39;s and my perspective, the evening for the Jewish Home and Hospital For The
        Aged at the Waldorf Astoria was a wonderful and warm event, made more so by your presence
        and the superb music that you and your orchestra provided.
      </p>
      <p>I am with kindest regards and great appreciation.</p>

        Once again, thank you for the wonderful music you provided us with for our annual client
        holiday reception. Larry King Productions did a wonderful job and everyone loved the music!
        As we discussed, we would like you to provide the music again next year at the Metropolitan
        Club.
      </p>
      <p>Again, thank you.</p>
